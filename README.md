# Multiscale Curvature Analysis

## About
This is a standalone multiscale curvature analysis software developed by [Matthew Spofford](https://github.com/MatthewSpofford).
The app is capable of reading and importing various types of surfaces files (.SUR, etc.).
Using these files, statistical regression and/or discrimination can be run on the imported surface data.

## Documentation
